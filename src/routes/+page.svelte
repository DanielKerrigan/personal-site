	I am an applied researcher at Capital One. I am interested in information visualization and its
	applications relating to machine learning. I did my Ph.D. at NYU and Northeastern and was advised
	by <a href="http://enrico.bertini.io">Enrico Bertini</a>. Prior to grad school, I worked as a
	software development engineer at Amazon Robotics and did my undergraduate studies at Notre Dame.
